## Java Basics
## OOP
    # Classes and Objects
    # Properties/Attributes
    # Methods
    # Constructors

    # Method Overloading
    # Modifiers
        - Access Modifiers - (
            public - The code is accessible for all classes, 
            private - The code is only accessible within the declared class, 
            default - The code is only accessible in the same package., 
            protected - The code is accessible in the same package and subclasses.
        )
        - Non-access Modifiers (classes/attributes/methods) - (
            final - class: The class cannot be inherited by other classes.
                    attributes/methods: The value cannot be overriden/modified
            static - class: X
                     attributes/method: Attributes and methods belongs to the class, rather than an object
            abstract - class: Cannot be used to create objects.
                       attributes: X
                       methods: Methods does not have a body.
